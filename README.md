# Handwritten Character Recognition - CodeAlpha Project

## Objective
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Techniques Used
To solve this problem, we used:
- Deep Learning with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)  
- Data normalization and reshaping for better training  
- Image classification techniques

## Dataset
We used the **MNIST dataset**, which contains:
- 60,000 images for training  
- 10,000 images for testing  
- Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale and represents a digit from 0 to 9

## Results
Our CNN model achieved **over 98% accuracy** on the test dataset.  
We used techniques like **dropout** and **pooling layers** to improve performance and avoid overfitting.
